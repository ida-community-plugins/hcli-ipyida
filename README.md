Plugin metadata for [eset/IPyIDA](https://github.com/eset/ipyida) by @marc-etienne.

This is a temporary repository. The metadata is used by [HexRaysSA/ida-hcli](https://github.com/HexRaysSA/ida-hcli) for installing IDA plugins.
Once this functionality is released into hcli, plugins.hex-rays.com, and IDA, then we'll work with the plugin authors to upstream this metadata.
